I recently started my PwC Switzerland virtual internship in collaboration with Forage. As a second task of the virtual internship, I developed a Call Center Trend Dashboard.

This helps the Call Center Manager to interpret and have an accurate overview of the long-term trends in Customer and agent behaviour. As a Data Analyst, my job was to visualize all relevant KPIs such as:

a) Overall customer satisfaction
b) Overall calls answered/abandoned
c) Calls by time
d) Average speed of answer, and
e) Agent's performance

Building a dashboard using Power Bi gives me more clarity about how actual work happens in Real-time by solving real case problems, it was a challenge as well as very exciting to learn.
